#1. How will you know when the problem is solved? (Identify the big-picture goal)
#  the customer service representative will be able to accept & respond to user input and the program will be able to end
#2. How do you want to use the software? (Identity the "interface")
# command line?
#3. What's the (next-)most trivial possible case? (Identify the next small-picture goal)
# listed below
#4. How do we achieve this goal? (Sketch an algorithm using pseudocode)
# listed below
# PARAMETERS
# initial ouput: "HELLO, THIS IS A GROCERY STORE!"
# accept and analyze user input based on the following rules:
#  - If you don't hit anything (just hit enter) response is: "HELLO?!"
#  - questions with any lower-case letters the response is: "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU."
#  - questions in all upper-case letters the response is: "NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE"
#  - the first input "GOODBYE!" response is "ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP YOU WITH?"
#  - the second input "GOODBYE!" response is "THANK YOU FOR CALLING!" and the program exits

#PSEUDOCODE
# 1. write initial output and create a variable with user input
# 2. if user input is just enter output "HELLO"
# 3. if user input has any lower-case letters ouput "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU."
# 4. if user input is all upper-case letters output "NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE"
# 5. first user input "GOODBYE!" output "ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP YOU WITH?"
# 6. second user input "GOODBYE!" output "THANK YOU FOR CALLING!" and exit the program
